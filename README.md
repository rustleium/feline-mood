# 🐾 Feline Mood
> A deeply unnecessary yet spiritually essential piece of software about feline moods.

It uses:
- Webpack (because I heard real developers use it),
- ES6 modules (so the code *feels* modular and important),
- and DOM manipulation (to simulate feelings... for a cat... on your screen).

## 🧠 Why?
I asked myself that too. Several times. But here we are.

#### Known Bugs
Sometimes the cat mood appears stubborn, displaying the same mood multiple times in a row.
